# Vulnerability type
CWE-281: Improper Preservation of Permissions

# Description
Missing step in Signal Private Messenger ("Signal") device change scenarios across multiple platforms allows an attacker to masquerade as a victim Signal user to the victim's contacts. Signal at time of writing does not rotate the safety key ("safety number") between a user pair upon re-installation of the application, nor on transfer of application data from one device to another using a method such as iOS Quick Start, despite clear indication in the Signal documentation this must occur in order to let the user's contacts know the user's device or installation has changed. Failure of key rotation results in lack of non-repudiation of communications and indeterminate potential for impersonation and man-in-the-middle attacks.
